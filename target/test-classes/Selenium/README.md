# Selenium

Selenium (.java) files are JUnit exported Automated Tests that can be run directly from your IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ, VSCode, etc) by simply configuring a corresponding Selenium WebDriver. You can automate any of the following browsers:

* FireFox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
* Chrome: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
* Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
* IE: https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=3.141/
* Safari: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/testing_with_webdriver_in_safari
* Opera: https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases



# Selenium IDE

These (.side) files are JSON configurations representing the recorded tests that can be played back as needed to avoid as many of the toils of Manual Testing as possible.

These can be run ad hoc or scheduled, via either of the following:

* Command-line
  - SIDE runner (requires NodeJS/NPM): https://selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/introduction/command-line-runner  
* Browser Plugins
  - FireFox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/
  - Chrome:  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd
